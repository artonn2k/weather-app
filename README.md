# weather-app
This is a weather app built by using React.js , I did it to practice my first basic skills that I learned recently.

For this weather app I have used this API: https://openweathermap.org/api
It is free, you need just to sing up if you dont have an account.
Openweathermap https://openweathermap.org/ offers you the opportunity to create your personal API key.

URL Example: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={name_of_the_city}&appid={your_personal_api_key}

I have also used two librarys that npm offers: 

- axios -
used for fetching the weather data from the API

- styled-components 

https://styled-components.com/

This is my first time using this library, it offers you such an easy way to style your components.
Here you have the link down below to an youtube video that can introduce you to styled-components library.
Try it, ez to learn and ez to use it too!
